# Limitation Question

## Limitation
- Cost/latency evidence gap and workload sensitivity

## Question to Answer
- Does Contex pass floor/median scorecard targets across 3 CI dataset families with correctness guard enabled?

## Hypothesis
- Contex reaches floor >= 35% and median >= 60% reduction for this CI dataset set.

## Decision Threshold
- scorecard strict gate must pass; correctness checks must pass
