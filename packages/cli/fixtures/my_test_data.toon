Using the same logic here as what we do for View Transitions to determine if ParentInstance is a "hidden" boundary to avoid animation.

## Summary

Follow-up to https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/89823 with the actual changes to React.

Replaces the `JSON.parse` reviver callback in `initializeModelChunk` with a two-step approach: plain `JSON.parse()` followed by a recursive `walkParsedJSON()` post-process. This yields a **~75% speedup** in RSC chunk deserialization.

| Payload | Original (ms) | Walk (ms) | Speedup |
|---------|---------------|-----------|---------|
| Small (2 elements, 142B) | 0.0024 | 0.0007 | **+72%** |
| Medium (~12 elements, 914B) | 0.0116 | 0.0031 | **+73%** |
| Large (~90 elements, 16.7KB) | 0.1836 | 0.0451 | **+75%** |
| XL (~200 elements, 25.7KB) | 0.3742 | 0.0913 | **+76%** |
| Table (1000 rows, 110KB) | 3.0862 | 0.6887 | **+78%** |

## Problem

`createFromJSONCallback` returns a reviver function passed as the second argument to `JSON.parse()`. This reviver is called for **every key-value pair** in the parsed JSON. While the logic inside the reviver is lightweight, the dominant cost is the **C++ → JavaScript boundary crossing** — V8's `JSON.parse` is implemented in C++, and calling back into JavaScript for every node incurs significant overhead.

Even a trivial no-op reviver `(k, v) => v` makes `JSON.parse` **~4x slower** than bare `JSON.parse` without a reviver:

```
108 KB payload:
  Bare JSON.parse:    0.60 ms
  Trivial reviver:    2.95 ms  (+391%)
```

## Change

Replace the reviver with a two-step process:

1. `JSON.parse(resolvedModel)` — parse the entire payload in C++ with no callbacks
2. `_walkJSON` — recursively walk the resulting object in pure JavaScript to apply RSC transformations (resolving `$`-prefixed special strings, constructing React elements, handling `initializingHandler` protocol)

The `_walkJSON` function includes additional optimizations over the original reviver:
- **Short-circuits plain strings**: only calls `parseModelString` when the string starts with `$`, skipping the vast majority of strings (class names, text content, etc.)
- **Recognizes React element arrays** (`["$", type, key, props]`) upfront and processes each field with knowledge of its expected type, avoiding generic traversal
- **Stays entirely in JavaScript** — no C++ boundary crossings during the walk

## Results

You can find the related applications in the [Next.js PR ](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/89823)as I've been testing this on Next.js applications.

- [ ] React Compiler core (the JS output is incorrect, or your app works incorrectly after optimization)
- [ ] babel-plugin-react-compiler (build issue installing or using the Babel plugin)
- [ ] eslint-plugin-react-hooks (build issue installing or using the eslint plugin)
- [x] react-compiler-healthcheck (build issue installing or using the healthcheck script)

### Link to repro

N/A — feature request.

### Repro steps

Healthcheck only prints "Successfully compiled X out of Y components" and does not show which components failed.

**Proposal:** Add a `--verbose` flag to print for each failed component:
- file path
- location (line/column when available)
- error reason

The data is already collected in `ActionableFailures` / `OtherFailures` in `reactCompiler.ts`; it only needs to be printed when the flag is set. That would make it possible to fix remaining violations and to trust the reported counts.

**Related:** #29078 (closed), #29677 (open — "how do I find the remaining components?").

Enables Basic View Transition support for React Native Fabric renderer.

**Implemented:**
- Added FabricUIManager bindings for view transition methods: `measureInstance`, `applyViewTransitionName`, `startViewTransition`, `restoreViewTransitionName`, and `cancelViewTransitionName`
- Implemented `startViewTransition` with proper callback orchestration (mutation → layout → afterMutation → spawnedWork → passive)
- Added fallback behavior that flushes work synchronously when Fabric's `startViewTransition` returns false (e.g., when the ViewTransition ReactNativeFeatureFlag is not enabled)
- Added Flow type declarations for new FabricUIManager methods

**Stubbed with `__DEV__` warnings (not yet implemented):**
- `cancelRootViewTransitionName`
- `restoreRootViewTransitionName`
- `cloneRootViewTransitionContainer`
- `removeRootViewTransitionClone`
- `measureClonedInstance`
- `hasInstanceChanged`
- `hasInstanceAffectedParent`
- `startGestureTransition`
- `stopViewTransition`
- `getCurrentGestureOffset`

This allows React Native apps using Fabric to leverage the View Transition API for coordinated animations during state transitions, with graceful degradation when the native side doesn't support it.

## How did you test this change?

- `yarn flow fabric` - Flow type checks pass
- `yarn lint` - Lint checks pass
- Manually tested in Android catalyst app with enableViewTransition in `ReactFeatureFlags.test-renderer.native-fb.js` and View Transition enabled via ReactNativeFeatureFlag
- Verified in the minified `ReactFabric-dev.fb.js` that the 'shim' config functions are not included
- Verified fallback behavior logs warning in `__DEV__` and flushes work synchronously when ViewTransition flag isn't enabled in Fabric		{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35764/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}	https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35764/timeline

### Repro steps

1. Create a component that receives a nullable prop
2. Access that prop's properties inside a closure (event handler)
3. Add an early return guard: if (!prop) return null
4. Pass null/undefined as the prop
5. Component throws TypeError during render

------------------------

# React Compiler hoists closure property accesses into cache keys, causing TypeError

## Summary

The React Compiler generates memoization cache keys by eagerly evaluating property accesses that were originally deferred inside closures (event handlers). This causes `TypeError` at render time when the object is `null`/`undefined`, even though the original code would never access the property during render.

Early returns (`if (!x) return null`) do not help — the compiler hoists the cache key check above the guard.

JSX expressions are not affected — the compiler correctly extracts them to intermediate variables.

## Reproduction

[React Compiler Playground](https://playground.react.dev/)

### Minimal case

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ user }) => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log(user.name);
  };

  if (!user) return null;

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;
};
```

Compiled output:

```js
const MyComponent = (t0) => {
  const $ = _c(4);
  const { user } = t0;

  // Cache key runs BEFORE the null guard — throws when user is null
  if ($[0] !== user.name) {
    t1 = () => {
      console.log(user.name);
    };
    $[0] = user.name;
    $[1] = t1;
  }

  // The null guard comes AFTER — too late
  if (!user) {
    return null;
  }

  // ...
};
```

The source code is safe: `user.name` is only inside a click handler, and the early return prevents the button from rendering when `user` is null. But the compiler hoists `user.name` into a cache key that runs on **every render**, before the guard.

### With nested access and JSX

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ user }) => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);
  const [link, setLink] = useState(null);

  const handleClick = async () => {
    console.log(user.company.id);
    console.log(user.email);
  };

  return (
    <div onClick={() => setVisible(false)}>
      <span>{user?.email}</span>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

Compiled output (simplified):

```js
// The compiler hoists user.company.id and user.email from the closure
// into cache key checks that run on EVERY render:
if ($[0] !== user.company.id || $[1] !== user.email) {
    t1 = async () => {
      console.log(user.company.id);
      console.log(user.email);
    };
    $[0] = user.company.id;
    $[1] = user.email;
    $[2] = t1;
}

// JSX — correctly extracted to variable (safe)
const t4 = user?.email;
if ($[7] !== t4) {
    t5 = <span>{t4}</span>;
}
```

## Expected behavior

The compiler should not introduce runtime errors that the source code would not produce. Property accesses hoisted from closures into cache keys should be guarded, e.g. by extracting to intermediate variables:

```js
const t0 = user?.name;
if ($[0] !== t0) {
    t1 = () => {
      console.log(user.name);
    };
    $[0] = t0;
    $[1] = t1;
}
```

## Workarounds

### 1. Extract to variables

Extract property accesses into variables before using them in closures. The compiler then caches on the primitive values:

```jsx
const companyId = user?.company?.id;
const email = user?.email;

const handleClick = async () => {
  console.log(companyId);
  console.log(email);
};
```

### 2. Add optional chaining to every closure access

Adding `?.` to every property access inside closures makes the compiler preserve it in cache keys. Note that **every** access must have `?.` — missing it on even one will produce an unsafe cache key for that property path:

```jsx
const handleClick = async () => {
  console.log(user?.company.id);
  console.log(user?.email);
};
```

### 3. Use nullish coalescing on destructuring

Using `?? {}` when destructuring the nullable object anywhere in the component signals to the compiler that the value can be nullish. This makes the compiler generate `?.` in **all** cache keys for that object:

```jsx
const handleClick = () => {
  const { name, email } = user ?? {};
  console.log(name, email);
};
```

This produces `$[x] !== user?.name` instead of `$[x] !== user.name` in cache keys across the component.

### 4. Add a null guard inside the closure

Adding a null check before the property access inside the closure makes the compiler use the **object reference** as the cache key instead of the property path:

```jsx
const handleClick = () => {
  if (!user) return;
  console.log(user.company.id);
  console.log(user.email);
};
```

This produces `$[x] !== user` (the reference) instead of `$[x] !== user.company.id` (the property access) in the cache key. Comparing a reference to `null`/`undefined` never throws.

## Environment

- React Compiler (babel plugin via `react-compiler-runtime`)
- Webpack 5 with HMR
- Observed in both HMR hot-update bundles and regular builds

these are not properly cleaned up, so will not be properly GC'd away
overtime, these will lead to an OOM situation

This PR refactors `ReactProfilerTimer.js` to correctly track transition timers on a per-lane basis, addressing a long-standing TODO (`// TODO: This should really be one per Transition lane.`).

Previously, transition timings (start time, update time, event time) were stored in global variables (`transitionStartTime`, `transitionUpdateTime`, etc.). This caused issues when multiple transitions were being processed concurrently or interleaved, as the global state could be overwritten, leading to inaccurate profiling data.

## Key Changes

### `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactProfilerTimer.js`
* Replaced global transition timer variables with a `transitionTimers` Map, keyed by `Lane`.
* Introduced `WeakMap`s (`pendingTransitionStartTimes`, `pendingTransitionEventInfo`) to buffer timing data associated with a `Transition` object before a specific `Lane` is assigned.
* Updated `startUpdateTimerByLane`, `startHostActionTimer`, `startAsyncTransitionTimer`, and other helper functions to read/write from the `transitionTimers` Map instead of global variables.
* Added `getTransitionTimers(lane)` to safely retrieve timer data for a specific lane.

### `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js`
* Updated the `includesTransitionLane` block in the work loop logic.
* It now iterates through all active transition lanes using `getHighestPriorityLane`.
* For each lane, it retrieves the corresponding timer data and logs the transition start/update.
* Ensures `clearTransitionTimer(lane)` is called for the specific lane being processed, rather than a global clear.

## Verification

### Automated Tests
* Passed `yarn test packages/react-reconciler/src/__tests__/ReactTransitionTracing-test.js`
* Passed `yarn test packages/react-reconciler/src/__tests__/ReactPerformanceTrack-test.js`

### Manual Verification
* Verified that no regressions were introduced in basic profiling behavior.

The `ReactProfilerTimer.js` module currently uses a set of global variables (`transitionStartTime`, `transitionUpdateTime`, `transitionUpdateType`, etc.) to track performance metrics for transitions.

This implementation assumes only one transition is being tracked at a time. However, with concurrent rendering, multiple transitions can be in progress simultaneously in different lanes.

There is an explicit TODO in the code acknowledging this issue:

```javascript
// packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactProfilerTimer.js

// TODO: This should really be one per Transition lane.
export let transitionClampTime: number = -0;
export let transitionStartTime: number = -1.1; // First startTransition call before setState.
export let transitionUpdateTime: number = -1.1; // First transition setState scheduled.
```
## Impact
When multiple concurrent transitions occur, the following issues arise:

1. **Data Overwrites:** Concurrent transitions will overwrite each other's timing data in these global variables.
2. **Inaccurate Profiling:** `ReactFiberWorkLoop` will read incorrect start/update times, leading to inaccurate performance profiling data.
3. **Race Conditions:** It may cause race conditions where the wrong transition's data is logged or used for heuristics.

## Proposed Solution
Refactor `ReactProfilerTimer.js` to avoid global state for transition timings.

* **Structure:** Store transition timing data in a structure keyed by the transition lane, such as `Map<Lane, TransitionTimers>`.
* **Implementation:** The `ReactFiberWorkLoop` and other consumers should be updated to pass the relevant `Lane` when recording or reading transition timings, ensuring that data is isolated per transition.

Fixes #34905

The `set-state-in-effect` validation (`ValidateNoSetStateInEffects`) was incorrectly flagging `setState` calls that appear **after an `await`** expression inside async functions called from `useEffect`.

After an `await`, execution continues asynchronously in a microtask — meaning the `setState` call is no longer synchronous within the effect body and should not trigger this lint.

### Root cause

In `getSetStateCall()`, the function walks through the HIR of the effect callback and returns the first `setState` call it finds, without distinguishing whether that call appears after an `Await` instruction.

### Fix

Added `Await` instruction tracking within each block in `getSetStateCall()`:
- When an `Await` instruction is encountered, a `seenAwait` flag is set for the current block
- Any subsequent `setState` call in the same block after an `Await` is skipped (not reported as synchronous)

This is a conservative fix scoped to intra-block tracking. Cross-block `await` dominator analysis can be added as a follow-up if needed.

## How did you test this change?

Added 3 new test fixtures:

| Fixture | Expected | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `allow-setState-in-useEffect-after-await` | ✅ No error | setState after `await` via `useCallback` + `useEffect` (exact issue repro) |
| `allow-setState-in-useEffect-async-callback` | ✅ No error | setState after `await` in nested async function inside `useEffect` |
| `invalid-setState-in-useEffect-before-await` | ❌ Error reported | setState **before** `await` is still correctly flagged |

All existing tests continue to pass:

```

When attempting to use `eslint` 10.x.x with eslint-plugin-react, I encounter dependency resolution issues, specifically that the plugin does not support ESLint 10.

React version: `19.2.4`

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Install `eslint` 10.x.x along with `eslint-plugin-react@7.37.5`.
2. Install dependencies
3. Encounter peer dependency conflict or related errors.

## The current behavior
- Peer dependency conflicts or errors occur during installation or usage of ESLint 10 with this plugin.

## The expected behavior
- `eslint-plugin-react` should support ESLint 10.x.x without errors.		{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35729/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":7,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}	https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35729/timeline

* `packages/react/src/ReactStartTransition.js`: Added a `now()` helper (using `performance.now()` with a `Date.now()` fallback) and used it to set `currentTransition.startTime`.
* `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js`: Removed the check for `transition.startTime === -1` and the subsequent assignment, as it is no longer needed.

## Motivation

Previously, `startTime` was initialized to `-1` and lazily updated upon scheduling an update. This behavior was inconsistent with `useTransition` and could lead to inaccurate timestamps if there was a delay between the transition start and the actual update scheduling. This change standardizes the behavior and ensures accurate timing for transition tracing.

## How to Test

1. Enable `enableTransitionTracing` feature flag.
2. Run `yarn test ReactTransitionTracing`.
3. Verify that tests pass and that transition start times are reasonable (non-negative).

## Checklist

- [x] Tests passed locally (`yarn test ReactTransitionTracing`).
- [x] I have addressed the TODOs in the codebase.

Currently, calls to `startTransition` and `startGestureTransition` in `packages/react/src/ReactStartTransition.js` initialize `currentTransition.startTime` to `-1`. There is a TODO comment indicating that this should read the timestamp.

The timestamp is currently lazily set in `ReactFiberWorkLoop.js` when an update is scheduled. This behavior differs from `useTransition`, which correctly sets the start time immediately.

This issue proposes to:

1. Initialize `startTime` using `performance.now()` (falling back to `Date.now()`) directly in `startTransition` and `startGestureTransition`.
2. Remove the lazy initialization logic in `ReactFiberWorkLoop.js`.

This ensures the timestamp accurately reflects when the transition was started, even if updates are processed later.

## Relevant Files
* `packages/react/src/ReactStartTransition.js`
* `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.js`

## Steps to Reproduce (or verify)
1. Enable `enableTransitionTracing`.
2. Inspect `currentTransition.startTime` immediately after creating a transition via `startTransition`. Ideally, it should hold a valid timestamp instead of `-1`.		{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35725/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}	https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35725/timeline

This violates the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) principle for version management.

While `scripts/shared/ReactVersions.js` manages package versions during the release process and updates `package.json`, it does not update this hardcoded string in the source file. Since this package is published without a bundling step that injects the version (based on the `files` field in `package.json`), it relies on manual updates, which are prone to human error and version mismatches.

**React version:** `main` branch

## Steps To Reproduce

1. Go to `packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/index.ts` in the main branch.
2. Check the `meta.version` property in the exported plugin object.
3. Observe that it is a hardcoded string rather than a dynamic reference to `package.json`.

**Link to code example:**
https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/index.ts

## The current behavior

The version is explicitly hardcoded in the source file, which creates a risk of metadata inconsistency if the release script updates `package.json` but misses this file.
```typescript
// Current implementation
const plugin = {
  meta: {
    name: 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks',
    version: '7.0.0', // Hardcoded string
  },
  rules,
  configs,
};
```

## The expected behavior

Since ESLint plugins run in a Node.js environment, the version should be dynamically retrieved from `package.json`. This ensures that the runtime version always matches the published package metadata without requiring manual synchronization or complex build injections.

Since the codebase uses TypeScript with ES modules, we should use `import` to dynamically load the version, which is the idiomatic approach in TypeScript/ESM for ensuring SSOT.
```typescript
// Proposed change
import pkg from '../package.json';

const plugin = {
  meta: {
    name: 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks',
    version: pkg.version, // Dynamic reference from package.json
  },
  rules,
  configs,
};

export default plugin;
```
**References:** 
[ESLint official documentation on Plugin Metadata](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#meta-data-in-plugins). While the documentation shows various examples, the principle of dynamically sourcing metadata from `package.json` is a recommended best practice for maintaining version consistency.		{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}	https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35722/timeline

### Summary

Fixes #1159 — an 11-year-old bug where browser autofill breaks controlled components.

When browsers autofill form fields (saved passwords, address autocomplete, password managers), they may set the input value **without firing `input` or `change` events**. This causes controlled components to have stale state — the user sees filled data but React state remains empty. On form submission, data is lost.

#### Root Cause

React's `ChangeEventPlugin` detects value changes via `getTargetInstForInputOrChangeEvent()`, which only checks values when `input` or `change` DOM events fire. When browsers autofill without events (e.g., Chrome on iOS, some password managers), React never checks and never fires `onChange`.

#### Fix

Add value change detection on `focusin` events for text inputs. The `focusin` event is already registered as a dependency of `onChange` but was unused for modern browsers. When a user focuses an autofilled field, React now checks if the DOM value differs from its tracked value (via `updateValueIfChanged()`) and fires `onChange` if so.

This is safe because:
- `updateValueIfChanged()` compares the value tracker with the actual DOM value — if they match, no event fires (zero false positives)
- `focusin` already bubbles to the root and is captured by React's event delegation
- Browsers expose autofill values after the first user interaction (focus)

#### Change

**1 function modified** in `ChangeEventPlugin.js` (+7 lines):

```js
function getTargetInstForInputOrChangeEvent(domEventName, targetInst) {
  if (domEventName === 'input' || domEventName === 'change') {
    return getInstIfValueChanged(targetInst);
  }
  // NEW: Detect browser autofill on focus
  if (domEventName === 'focusin') {
    return getInstIfValueChanged(targetInst);
  }
}
```

#### Coverage

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| iOS Chrome autofill (no events) | onChange never fires | onChange fires on focus |
| Desktop autofill (events suppressed) | onChange may not fire | onChange fires on focus |
| Password manager fill | Inconsistent | onChange fires on focus |
| Normal focus (no autofill) | No onChange | No onChange (correct) |
| Focus after typing | No extra onChange | No extra onChange (correct) |

#### Known Limitations

- If the user never focuses any field and submits directly, autofill values won't be detected (rare edge case)
- Multiple autofilled fields require each to be focused individually
- Pre-hydration autofill needs a separate fix

#### Test Plan

- [x] 3 new tests added to `ReactDOMInput-test.js`
- [x] All 127 tests in ReactDOMInput-test pass
- [x] All 3812 tests across 129 react-dom test suites pass (0 regressions)

### Summary

Fixes #33580 — "Rendered more hooks than during the previous render" when a component calls `use(thenable)` conditionally after hydration.

#### Root Cause

When a component suspends mid-render (e.g., after `useState` but before `useMemo`), `resetHooksOnUnwind` is called and the work-in-progress (WIP) fiber retains only the hooks that were processed before the interruption. If this WIP fiber is later **committed** — for example, as part of a Suspense boundary showing its fallback — the incomplete hook chain replaces the current fiber's complete chain.

On the next render, `updateWorkInProgressHook` tries to clone hooks from the (now-corrupted) current fiber but runs out of entries, throwing:

> Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.

#### The Fix

In `resetHooksOnUnwind`, before clearing `currentHook` and `workInProgressHook`, we now clone the remaining unprocessed hooks from the current fiber and append them to the WIP hook chain. This ensures the chain is always complete when committed, preserving hook integrity across Suspense fallback commits.

```js
// In resetHooksOnUnwind, before clearing hook pointers:
if (currentHook !== null && workInProgressHook !== null) {
  let nextCurrentHook = currentHook.next;
  if (nextCurrentHook !== null) {
    let tail = workInProgressHook;
    while (nextCurrentHook !== null) {
      const clone = {
        memoizedState: nextCurrentHook.memoizedState,
        baseState: nextCurrentHook.baseState,
        baseQueue: nextCurrentHook.baseQueue,
        queue: nextCurrentHook.queue,
        next: null,
      };
      tail = tail.next = clone;
      nextCurrentHook = nextCurrentHook.next;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Reproduction Conditions

The bug requires a specific combination of **6 interacting conditions**:

1. **Server-side rendering** with hydration (`hydrateRoot`)
2. **ErrorBoundary inside Suspense** — triggers `ForceClientRender` during hydration
3. **Cascading state update** — `setState` in `useEffect` triggers re-render
4. **Transition update** — `startTransition(() => setPromise(...))` at lower priority
5. **Conditional `use(thenable)`** — `promise ? use(promise) : promise` causes suspension when promise becomes non-null
6. **Additional hooks after `use()`** — `useMemo` (or any hook) comes after the conditional `use()` call

#### Sequence of Events

```
1. Page hydration mount → 2 hooks committed (useState + useMemo) ✅
2. Effect fires → setPromise(promise) in transition
3. Page re-renders → useState ✅ → use(promise) → SUSPENDS ❌
   └─ WIP fiber now has only 1 hook (useState)
4. Suspense boundary commits fallback → WIP (1 hook) becomes current
5. Promise resolves → replay → currentHooks=1, needs 2 → ERROR 💥
```

#### Test Plan

- [x] Added regression test in `ReactDOMFizzShellHydration-test.js` that reproduces the exact conditions
- [x] All existing tests pass:
  - `ReactDOMFizzShellHydration-test.js` — 11/11 ✅
  - `ReactHooks-test.internal.js` — 72/72 ✅
  - `ReactSuspenseWithNoopRenderer-test.js` — 69/69 ✅
  - `ReactUse-test.js` — 48/48 ✅
  - `ReactHooksWithNoopRenderer-test.js` — 96/96 ✅

## Summary
<!--
 While profiling, React DevTools can receive remove operations for nodes that are not present in the Store. This can happen due to event ordering during concurrent rendering or StrictMode, especially when profiling is started or stopped mid-update.

The current behavior throws an error when attempting to remove a missing node, which aborts the Store update and prevents remaining operations from being processed, leaving our store in a partially updated state.

Change: 

            if (element === undefined) {
              /*
                - there may be further nodes in the batch to be processed hence throwing error right now is not a good soln
                - Our store may be partially updated because of this logic 
                - So I changed it to look for further nodes and skip removing this node 
                - logically as it is absent so its better logically
              */
              i += 1;
              continue;
            }

This change treats removal of a missing node as a no-op, skips the invalid operation while preserving operation stream alignment, and allows subsequent removals to continue, preventing DevTools from crashing in this recoverable scenario. -->

## How did you test this change?

<!--
Built React DevTools locally after applying the change.
Verified that the Components and Profiler tabs continue to function normally.
Tested profiling start/stop flows to ensure DevTools no longer aborts Store updates when encountering missing nodes.
Confirmed that skipping invalid removals does not introduce regressions and that remaining operations in the batch are still processed correctly.

called in certain parent click event scenarios.

The ChangeEventPlugin now ensures checkbox and radio inputs always
enqueue change events when their value changes, aligning React
behavior with expected DOM semantics.

A regression test has been added.

Pode me ajudar?

Desculpe! Uma extensão do navegador pode ter causado um erro.

Sabe-se que ferramentas de tradução do navegador (como o Tradutor integrado do Chrome) ou algumas extensões de navegador de terceiros causam erros ao usar o Painel de Controle do Supabase.

Recomendamos fortemente desativar o Chrome Translate ou certas extensões do navegador ao usar o Painel de Controle da Supabase para evitar esse erro. Tente atualizar a página para ver se o problema persiste.

  This PR addresses two open issues:

  ### 1. Support autoFocus as a global HTML attribute
  (#35656)

  `autoFocus` is a [global HTML
  attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/W
  eb/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus) per the spec,
  but React only handled it for `button`, `input`,
  `select`, and `textarea`. This change treats
  `autoFocus` as a global attribute so it works on
  **any focusable element** — anchor tags, `<div
  tabIndex={0}>`, `<dialog>`, `<details>`, etc.

  Changes:
  - `finalizeInitialChildren`: default case now returns
   `!!props.autoFocus`
  - `commitMount`: default case now calls `.focus()`
  when `autoFocus` is set
  - Added tests for `<a autoFocus>` and `<div
  tabIndex={0} autoFocus>`

  ### 2. Fix ReDoS vulnerabilities in stack trace
  parsing (#35490)

  Two regex patterns in `parseStackTrace.js` are
  vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking:

  - **`firefoxFrameRegExp`**: `(?:.*".+")?[^@]*`
  contains overlapping quantifiers. Replaced with
  `[^@"]*(?:"[^"]*"[^@"]*)*` using non-overlapping
  character classes.
  - **`CHROME_STACK_REGEXP`**: `.*(\S+:\d+|\(native\))`
   causes O(n²) backtracking. Simplified to `/^\s*at
  /m`.		{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0}	https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35693/timeline
