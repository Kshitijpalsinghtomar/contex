This yields a **~75% speedup** in RSC chunk deserialization.\r\n\r\n| Payload | Original (ms) | Walk (ms) | Speedup |\r\n|---------|---------------|-----------|---------|\r\n| Small (2 elements, 142B) | 0.0024 | 0.0007 | **+72%** |\r\n| Medium (~12 elements, 914B) | 0.0116 | 0.0031 | **+73%** |\r\n| Large (~90 elements, 16.7KB) | 0.1836 | 0.0451 | **+75%** |\r\n| XL (~200 elements, 25.7KB) | 0.3742 | 0.0913 | **+76%** |\r\n| Table (1000 rows, 110KB) | 3.0862 | 0.6887 | **+78%** |\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\n`createFromJSONCallback` returns a reviver function passed as the second argument to `JSON.parse()`. This reviver is called for **every key-value pair** in the parsed JSON. While the logic inside the reviver is lightweight, the dominant cost is the **C++ → JavaScript boundary crossing** — V8's `JSON.parse` is implemented in C++, and calling back into JavaScript for every node incurs significant overhead.\r\n\r\nEven a trivial no-op reviver `(k, v) => v` makes `JSON.parse` **~4x slower** than bare `JSON.parse` without a reviver:\r\n\r\n```\r\n108 KB payload:\r\n  Bare JSON.parse:    0.60 ms\r\n  Trivial reviver:    2.95 ms  (+391%)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Change\r\n\r\nReplace the reviver with a two-step process:\r\n\r\n1. `JSON.parse(resolvedModel)` — parse the entire payload in C++ with no callbacks\r\n2. `_walkJSON` — recursively walk the resulting object in pure JavaScript to apply RSC transformations (resolving `$`-prefixed special strings, constructing React elements, handling `initializingHandler` protocol)\r\n\r\nThe `_walkJSON` function includes additional optimizations over the original reviver:\r\n- **Short-circuits plain strings**: only calls `parseModelString` when the string starts with `$`, skipping the vast majority of strings (class names, text content, etc.)\r\n- **Recognizes React element arrays** (`[\"$\", type, key, props]`) upfront and processes each field with knowledge of its expected type, avoiding generic traversal\r\n- **Stays entirely in JavaScript** — no C++ boundary crossings during the walk\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\nYou can find the related applications in the [Next.js PR ](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/89823)as I've been testing this on Next.js applications.\r\n\r\n### Table as Server Component with 1000 items\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"min\": 13.782875000000786,\r\n    \"max\": 22.23400000000038,\r\n    \"avg\": 17.116868530000083,\r\n    \"p50\": 17.10766700000022,\r\n    \"p75\": 18.50787499999933,\r\n    \"p95\": 20.426249999998618,\r\n    \"p99\": 21.814125000000786\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"min\": 10.963916999999128,\r\n    \"max\": 18.096083000000363,\r\n    \"avg\": 13.543286884999988,\r\n    \"p50\": 13.58350000000064,\r\n    \"p75\": 14.871791999999914,\r\n    \"p95\": 16.08429099999921,\r\n    \"p99\": 17.591458000000785\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Table as Client Component with 1000 items\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"min\": 3.888875000000553,\r\n    \"max\": 9.044959000000745,\r\n    \"avg\": 4.651271475000067,\r\n    \"p50\": 4.555749999999534,\r\n    \"p75\": 4.966624999999112,\r\n    \"p95\": 5.47754200000054,\r\n    \"p99\": 6.109499999998661\r\n````\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    \"min\": 3.5986250000005384,\r\n    \"max\": 5.374291000000085,\r\n    \"avg\": 4.142990245000046,\r\n    \"p50\": 4.10570799999914,\r\n    \"p75\": 4.392041999999492,\r\n    \"p95\": 4.740084000000934,\r\n    \"p99\": 5.1652500000000146\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Nested Suspense\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Requests:  200\r\n  Min:       73ms\r\n  Max:       106ms\r\n  Avg:       78ms\r\n  P50:       77ms\r\n  P75:       80ms\r\n  P95:       85ms\r\n  P99:       94ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Requests:  200\r\n  Min:       56ms\r\n  Max:       67ms\r\n  Avg:       59ms\r\n  P50:       58ms\r\n  P75:       60ms\r\n  P95:       65ms\r\n  P99:       66ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Even more nested Suspense (double-level Suspense)\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Requests:  200\r\n  Min:       159ms\r\n  Max:       208ms\r\n  Avg:       169ms\r\n  P50:       167ms\r\n  P75:       173ms\r\n  P95:       183ms\r\n  P99:       188ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  Requests:  200\r\n  Min:       125ms\r\n  Max:       170ms\r\n  Avg:       134ms\r\n  P50:       132ms\r\n  P75:       138ms\r\n  P95:       148ms\r\n  P99:       160ms\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nRan it across many Next.js benchmark applications.\r\n\r\nThe entire Next.js test suite passes with this change.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid.

Pass null/undefined as the prop\n5. Component throws TypeError during render\n\n------------------------\n\n# React Compiler hoists closure property accesses into cache keys, causing TypeError\n\n## Summary\n\nThe React Compiler generates memoization cache keys by eagerly evaluating property accesses that were originally deferred inside closures (event handlers). This causes `TypeError` at render time when the object is `null`/`undefined`, even though the original code would never access the property during render.\n\nEarly returns (`if (!x) return null`) do not help — the compiler hoists the cache key check above the guard.\n\nJSX expressions are not affected — the compiler correctly extracts them to intermediate variables.\n\n## Reproduction\n\n[React Compiler Playground](https://playground.react.dev/)\n\n### Minimal case\n\n```jsx\nconst MyComponent = ({ user }) => {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    console.log(user.name);\n  };\n\n  if (!user) return null;\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>;\n};\n```\n\nCompiled output:\n\n```js\nconst MyComponent = (t0) => {\n  const $ = _c(4);\n  const { user } = t0;\n\n  // Cache key runs BEFORE the null guard — throws when user is null\n  if ($[0] !== user.name) {\n    t1 = () => {\n      console.log(user.name);\n    };\n    $[0] = user.name;\n    $[1] = t1;\n  }\n\n  // The null guard comes AFTER — too late\n  if (!user) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\nThe source code is safe: `user.name` is only inside a click handler, and the early return prevents the button from rendering when `user` is null. But the compiler hoists `user.name` into a cache key that runs on **every render**, before the guard.\n\n### With nested access and JSX\n\n```jsx\nconst MyComponent = ({ user }) => {\n  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);\n  const [link, setLink] = useState(null);\n\n  const handleClick = async () => {\n    console.log(user.company.id);\n    console.log(user.email);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div onClick={() => setVisible(false)}>\n      <span>{user?.email}</span>\n      <button onClick={handleClick}>Click</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nCompiled output (simplified):\n\n```js\n// The compiler hoists user.company.id and user.email from the closure\n// into cache key checks that run on EVERY render:\nif ($[0] !== user.company.id || $[1] !== user.email) {\n    t1 = async () => {\n      console.log(user.company.id);\n      console.log(user.email);\n    };\n    $[0] = user.company.id;\n    $[1] = user.email;\n    $[2] = t1;\n}\n\n// JSX — correctly extracted to variable (safe)\nconst t4 = user?.email;\nif ($[7] !== t4) {\n    t5 = <span>{t4}</span>;\n}\n```\n\n## Expected behavior\n\nThe compiler should not introduce runtime errors that the source code would not produce. Property accesses hoisted from closures into cache keys should be guarded, e.g. by extracting to intermediate variables:\n\n```js\nconst t0 = user?.name;\nif ($[0] !== t0) {\n    t1 = () => {\n      console.log(user.name);\n    };\n    $[0] = t0;\n    $[1] = t1;\n}\n```\n\n## Workarounds\n\n### 1. Extract to variables\n\nExtract property accesses into variables before using them in closures. The compiler then caches on the primitive values:\n\n```jsx\nconst companyId = user?.company?.id;\nconst email = user?.email;\n\nconst handleClick = async () => {\n  console.log(companyId);\n  console.log(email);\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Add optional chaining to every closure access\n\nAdding `?.` to every property access inside closures makes the compiler preserve it in cache keys. Note that **every** access must have `?.` — missing it on even one will produce an unsafe cache key for that property path:\n\n```jsx\nconst handleClick = async () => {\n  console.log(user?.company.id);\n  console.log(user?.email);\n};\n```\n\n### 3. Use nullish coalescing on destructuring\n\nUsing `?? {}` when destructuring the nullable object anywhere in the component signals to the compiler that the value can be nullish. This makes the compiler generate `?.` in **all** cache keys for that object:\n\n```jsx\nconst handleClick = () => {\n  const { name, email } = user ?? {};\n  console.log(name, email);\n};\n```\n\nThis produces `$[x] !== user?.name` instead of `$[x] !== user.name` in cache keys across the component.\n\n### 4. Add a null guard inside the closure\n\nAdding a null check before the property access inside the closure makes the compiler use the **object reference** as the cache key instead of the property path:\n\n```jsx\nconst handleClick = () => {\n  if (!user) return;\n  console.log(user.company.id);\n  console.log(user.email);\n};\n```\n\nThis produces `$[x] !== user` (the reference) instead of `$[x] !== user.company.id` (the property access) in the cache key. Comparing a reference to `null`/`undefined` never throws.\n\n## Environment\n\n- React Compiler (babel plugin via `react-compiler-runtime`)\n- Webpack 5 with HMR\n- Observed in both HMR hot-update bundles and regular builds\n\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n18.3.1\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n1.0.0","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35762/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35762/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"pinned_comment":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35761","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35761/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35761/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35761/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/35761","id":3924918051,"node_id":"I_kwDOAJy2Ks7p8X8j","number":35761,"title":"Bug: react-reconciler v0.33+ in dev mode emits performance info which is not correctly cleaned up, leading to OOM errors","user":{"login":"rmaclean","id":1232733,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMzI3MzM=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1232733?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmaclean","html_url":"https://github.com/rmaclean","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmaclean/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmaclean/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmaclean/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmaclean/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmaclean/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmaclean/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmaclean/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmaclean/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rmaclean/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":155984160,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNTU5ODQxNjA=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/Status:%20Unconfirmed","name":"Status: Unconfirmed","color":"d4c5f9","default":false,"description":"A potential issue that we haven't yet confirmed as a bug"}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":1,"created_at":"2026-02-11T06:14:04Z","updated_at":"2026-02-11T09:42:00Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"<!--\n  Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is.

However, with concurrent rendering, multiple transitions can be in progress simultaneously in different lanes.\n\nThere is an explicit TODO in the code acknowledging this issue:\n\n```javascript\n// packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactProfilerTimer.js\n\n// TODO: This should really be one per Transition lane.\nexport let transitionClampTime: number = -0;\nexport let transitionStartTime: number = -1.1; // First startTransition call before setState.\nexport let transitionUpdateTime: number = -1.1; // First transition setState scheduled.\n```\n## Impact\nWhen multiple concurrent transitions occur, the following issues arise:\n\n1. **Data Overwrites:** Concurrent transitions will overwrite each other's timing data in these global variables.\n2. **Inaccurate Profiling:** `ReactFiberWorkLoop` will read incorrect start/update times, leading to inaccurate performance profiling data.\n3. **Race Conditions:** It may cause race conditions where the wrong transition's data is logged or used for heuristics.\n\n## Proposed Solution\nRefactor `ReactProfilerTimer.js` to avoid global state for transition timings.\n\n* **Structure:** Store transition timing data in a structure keyed by the transition lane, such as `Map<Lane, TransitionTimers>`.\n* **Implementation:** The `ReactFiberWorkLoop` and other consumers should be updated to pass the relevant `Lane` when recording or reading transition timings, ensuring that data is isolated per transition.\n\n## Affected Files\n* `packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactProfilerTimer.js`\n*

Summary\n\nFixes #34905\n\nThe `set-state-in-effect` validation (`ValidateNoSetStateInEffects`) was incorrectly flagging `setState` calls that appear **after an `await`** expression inside async functions called from `useEffect`.\n\nAfter an `await`, execution continues asynchronously in a microtask — meaning the `setState` call is no longer synchronous within the effect body and should not trigger this lint.\n\n### Root cause\n\nIn `getSetStateCall()`, the function walks through the HIR of the effect callback and returns the first `setState` call it finds, without distinguishing whether that call appears after an `Await` instruction.\n\n### Fix\n\nAdded `Await` instruction tracking within each block in `getSetStateCall()`:\n- When an `Await` instruction is encountered, a `seenAwait`

This behavior was inconsistent with `useTransition` and could lead to inaccurate timestamps if there was a delay between the transition start and the actual update scheduling. This change standardizes the behavior and ensures accurate timing for transition tracing.\r\n\r\n## How to Test\r\n\r\n1. Enable `enableTransitionTracing` feature flag.\r\n2.

This violates the Single Source of Truth (SSOT) principle for version management.\n\nWhile `scripts/shared/ReactVersions.js` manages package versions during the release process and updates `package.json`, it does not update this hardcoded string in the source file. Since this package is published without a bundling step that injects the version (based on the `files` field in `package.json`), it relies on manual updates, which are prone to human error and version mismatches.\n\n**React version:** `main` branch\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Go to `packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/index.ts` in the main branch.\n2. Check the `meta.version` property in the exported plugin object.\n3. Observe that it is a hardcoded string rather than a dynamic reference to `package.json`.\n\n**Link to code example:**\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/index.ts\n\n## The current behavior\n\nThe version is explicitly hardcoded in the source file, which creates a risk of metadata inconsistency if the release script updates `package.json` but misses this file.\n```typescript\n// Current implementation\nconst plugin = {\n  meta: {\n    name: 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks',\n    version: '7.0.0', // Hardcoded string\n  },\n  rules,\n  configs,\n};\n```\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nSince ESLint plugins run in a Node.js environment, the version should be dynamically retrieved from `package.json`. This ensures that the runtime version always matches the published package metadata without requiring manual synchronization or complex build injections.\n\nSince the codebase uses TypeScript with ES modules, we should use `import` to dynamically load the version, which is the idiomatic approach in TypeScript/ESM for ensuring SSOT.\n```typescript\n// Proposed change\nimport pkg from '../package.json';\n\nconst plugin = {\n  meta: {\n    name: 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks',\n    version: pkg.version, // Dynamic reference from package.json\n  },\n  rules,\n  configs,\n};\n\nexport default plugin;\n```\n**References:** \n[ESLint official documentation on Plugin Metadata](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/plugins#meta-data-in-plugins). While the documentation shows various examples, the principle of dynamically sourcing metadata from `package.json` is a recommended best practice for maintaining version consistency.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35722/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35722/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"pinned_comment":null},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35719","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35719/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35719/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35719/events","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35719","id":3911681735,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAJy2Ks7CPthc","number":35719,"title":"fix: detect autofilled values on focus for controlled inputs","user":{"login":"DukeDeSouth","id":51200688,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjUxMjAwNjg4","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/51200688?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DukeDeSouth","html_url":"https://github.com/DukeDeSouth","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DukeDeSouth/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DukeDeSouth/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DukeDeSouth/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DukeDeSouth/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DukeDeSouth/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DukeDeSouth/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DukeDeSouth/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DukeDeSouth/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DukeDeSouth/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":196858374,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxOTY4NTgzNzQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/labels/CLA%20Signed","name":"CLA Signed","color":"e7e7e7","default":false,"description":null}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":null,"comments":3,"created_at":"2026-02-08T01:01:14Z","updated_at":"2026-02-08T17:04:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"draft":false,"pull_request":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/pulls/35719","html_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35719","diff_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35719.diff","patch_url":"https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/35719.patch","merged_at":null},"body":"## Human View\n\n### Summary\n\nFixes #1159 — an 11-year-old bug where browser autofill breaks controlled components.\n\nWhen browsers autofill form fields (saved passwords, address autocomplete, password managers), they may set the input value **without firing `input` or `change` events**. This causes controlled components to have stale state — the user sees filled data but React state remains empty. On form submission, data is lost.\n\n#### Root Cause\n\nReact's `ChangeEventPlugin` detects value changes via `getTargetInstForInputOrChangeEvent()`, which only checks values when `input` or `change` DOM events fire. When browsers autofill without events (e.g., Chrome on iOS, some password managers), React never checks and never fires `onChange`.\n\n#### Fix\n\nAdd value change detection on `focusin` events for text inputs. The `focusin` event is already registered as a dependency of `onChange` but was unused for modern browsers. When a user focuses an autofilled field, React now checks if the DOM value differs from its tracked value (via `updateValueIfChanged()`) and fires `onChange` if so.\n\nThis is safe because:\n- `updateValueIfChanged()` compares the value tracker with the actual DOM value — if they match, no event fires (zero false positives)\n- `focusin` already bubbles to the root and is captured by React's event delegation\n- Browsers expose autofill values after the first user interaction (focus)\n\n#### Change\n\n**1 function modified** in `ChangeEventPlugin.js` (+7 lines):\n\n```js\nfunction getTargetInstForInputOrChangeEvent(domEventName, targetInst) {\n  if (domEventName === 'input' || domEventName === 'change') {\n    return getInstIfValueChanged(targetInst);\n  }\n  // NEW: Detect browser autofill on focus\n  if (domEventName === 'focusin') {\n    return getInstIfValueChanged(targetInst);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Coverage\n\n| Scenario | Before | After |\n|----------|--------|-------|\n| iOS Chrome autofill (no events) | onChange never fires | onChange fires on focus |\n| Desktop autofill (events suppressed) | onChange may not fire | onChange fires on focus |\n| Password manager fill | Inconsistent | onChange fires on focus |\n| Normal focus (no autofill) | No onChange | No onChange (correct) |\n| Focus after typing | No extra onChange | No extra onChange (correct) |\n\n#### Known Limitations\n\n- If the user never focuses any field and submits directly, autofill values won't be detected (rare edge case)\n- Multiple autofilled fields require each to be focused individually\n- Pre-hydration autofill needs a separate fix\n\n#### Test Plan\n\n- [x] 3 new tests added to `ReactDOMInput-test.js`\n- [x] All 127 tests in ReactDOMInput-test pass\n- [x] All 3812 tests across 129 react-dom test suites pass (0 regressions)\n\n---\n\n## AI View (DCCE Protocol v1.0)\n\n### Metadata\n- **Generator**: Claude (Anthropic) via Cursor IDE\n- **Methodology**: AI-assisted development with human oversight and review\n\n### AI Contribution Summary\n- Root cause analysis through code tracing\n- Solution design and implementation\n- Test development (3 new test cases)\n- Edge case analysis and verification\n\n### Verification Steps Performed\n1.

If this WIP fiber is later **committed** — for example, as part of a Suspense boundary showing its fallback — the incomplete hook chain replaces the current fiber's complete chain.\n\nOn the next render, `updateWorkInProgressHook` tries to clone hooks from the (now-corrupted) current fiber but runs out of entries, throwing:\n\n> Rendered more hooks than during the previous render.\n\n#### The Fix\n\nIn `resetHooksOnUnwind`, before clearing `currentHook` and `workInProgressHook`, we now clone the remaining unprocessed hooks from the current fiber and append them to the WIP hook chain. This ensures the chain is always complete when committed, preserving hook integrity across Suspense fallback commits.\n\n```js\n// In resetHooksOnUnwind, before clearing hook pointers:\nif (currentHook !== null && workInProgressHook !== null) {\n  let nextCurrentHook = currentHook.next;\n  if (nextCurrentHook !== null) {\n    let tail = workInProgressHook;\n    while (nextCurrentHook !== null) {\n      const clone = {\n        memoizedState: nextCurrentHook.memoizedState,\n        baseState: nextCurrentHook.baseState,\n        baseQueue: nextCurrentHook.baseQueue,\n        queue: nextCurrentHook.queue,\n        next: null,\n      };\n      tail = tail.next = clone;\n      nextCurrentHook = nextCurrentHook.next;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Reproduction Conditions\n\nThe bug requires a specific combination of **6 interacting conditions**:\n\n1. **Server-side rendering** with hydration (`hydrateRoot`)\n2. **ErrorBoundary inside Suspense** — triggers `ForceClientRender` during hydration\n3. **Cascading state update** — `setState` in `useEffect` triggers re-render\n4. **Transition update** — `startTransition(() => setPromise(...))` at lower priority\n5. **Conditional `use(thenable)`** — `promise ? use(promise) : promise` causes suspension when promise becomes non-null\n6. **Additional hooks after `use()`** — `useMemo` (or any hook) comes after the conditional `use()` call\n\n#### Sequence of Events\n\n```\n1. Page hydration mount → 2 hooks committed (useState + useMemo) ✅\n2. Effect fires → setPromise(promise) in transition\n3. Page re-renders → useState ✅ → use(promise) → SUSPENDS ❌\n   └─ WIP fiber now has only 1 hook (useState)\n4. Suspense boundary commits fallback → WIP (1 hook) becomes current\n5. Promise resolves → replay → currentHooks=1, needs 2 → ERROR 💥\n```\n\n#### Test Plan\n\n- [x] Added regression test in `ReactDOMFizzShellHydration-test.js` that reproduces the exact conditions\n- [x] All existing tests pass:\n  - `ReactDOMFizzShellHydration-test.js` — 11/11 ✅\n  - `ReactHooks-test.internal.js` — 72/72 ✅\n  - `ReactSuspenseWithNoopRenderer-test.js` — 69/69 ✅\n  - `ReactUse-test.js` — 48/48 ✅\n  - `ReactHooksWithNoopRenderer-test.js` — 96/96 ✅\n\n#### Related\n\n- #33580 — Original issue report\n- #34068 — Previous fix attempt (closed by stale bot, author was not confident in the approach)\n- Affects Next.js users: vercel/next.js#78063, vercel/next.js#76266\n\n---\n\n## AI View (DCCE Protocol v1.0)\n\n### Metadata\n- **Generator**: Claude (Anthropic) via Cursor IDE\n- **Methodology**: AI-assisted development with human oversight and review\n\n### AI Contribution Summary\n- Root cause analysis through code tracing\n- Solution design and implementation\n\n### Verification Steps Performed\n1.

Support autoFocus as a global HTML attribute\r\n  (#35656)\r\n\r\n  `autoFocus` is a [global HTML\r\n  attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/W\r\n  eb/HTML/Global_attributes/autofocus) per the spec,\r\n  but React only handled it for `button`, `input`,\r\n  `select`, and `textarea`. This change treats\r\n  `autoFocus` as a global attribute so it works on\r\n  **any focusable element** — anchor tags, `<div\r\n  tabIndex={0}>`, `<dialog>`, `<details>`, etc.\r\n\r\n  Changes:\r\n  - `finalizeInitialChildren`: default case now returns\r\n   `!!props.autoFocus`\r\n  - `commitMount`: default case now calls `.focus()`\r\n  when `autoFocus` is set\r\n  - Added tests for `<a autoFocus>` and `<div\r\n  tabIndex={0} autoFocus>`\r\n\r\n  ### 2. Fix ReDoS vulnerabilities in stack trace\r\n  parsing (#35490)\r\n\r\n  Two regex patterns in `parseStackTrace.js` are\r\n  vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking:\r\n\r\n  - **`firefoxFrameRegExp`**: `(?:.*\".+\")?[^@]*`\r\n  contains overlapping quantifiers. Replaced with\r\n  `[^@\"]*(?:\"[^\"]*\"[^@\"]*)*` using non-overlapping\r\n  character classes.\r\n  - **`CHROME_STACK_REGEXP`**: `.*(\\S+:\\d+|\\(native\\))`\r\n   causes O(n²) backtracking. Simplified to `/^\\s*at\r\n  /m`.","closed_by":null,"reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35693/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/facebook/react/issues/35693/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null}]
